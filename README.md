### Brain-Healthy Workplace through a neurodiversity lense
[Web Story + Report](https://www.hksinc.com/our-news/articles/mindful-design-mindful-people-neuroinclusive-workplaces/)

Workplace design and policy is slowly recognizing the unique sensory needs and cognitive patterns of neurodivergent individuals. In a recent applied research initiative, we integrated organizational psychology research on neurodivergent population with lived experience from neurodivergent employees from interviews and focus groups. We uncovered evidence-based strategies and actionable steps for creating more inclusive workplaces. We identified practical design and policy solutions, such as integrating structured cognitive breaks, quiet retreat spaces, and tailored collaboration zones.  

Design implications from this applied research focus on creating neuroinclusive environments by balancing sensory stimulation, providing clear spatial definitions, and fostering flexible interactions. Specific affordances include quiet focus zones with low stimulation, medium-stimulation areas for brainstorming and collaboration, and high-stimulation spaces for informal social connections. These spaces, clearly defined and thoughtfully designed, empower employees to thrive while respecting diverse cognitive needs.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
